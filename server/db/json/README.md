## Bible Versions as JSON files

Pulled from https://github.com/rkazakov/usfm2json/tree/master/json  
These are entire bible versions as JSON data  
Considering using in a mongodb as a backup if api throttling becomes an issue  
See https://github.com/bibleapi/bibleapi-rest for example on how to serve data
