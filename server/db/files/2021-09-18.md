Not weary, walk

Written in the instructions

Not seen, but hope

_1 Corinthians 13:13_  
**Wait for me**  
_Psalms 31:24_  
Don't give up, you will not stumble  
_Isaiah 40:31_  
Safe with me  
_Proverbs 18:10_

You will have my light  
_Psalms 18:28_  
I am faithful  
_2 Thessalonians 3:3_  
I heard you all

I will

Trust in me
