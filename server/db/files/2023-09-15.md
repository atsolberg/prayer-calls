## Psalm

Angels in glory say "We await you"  
You are coming, all is ready  
Father will tell me  
Son hold steady  
He wants to recieve you  
His heart yearns for you  
And the Father soon will say  
"Son go for them"  
It's about to happen  
Long we've awaited  
Heaven's yearning will be sated  
Satisfaction will go the Son  
There'll be no fraction in the Holy one  
Head and body united there  
No longer will you dispair  
It's about to be told  
It's about to unfold  
The story of the glory  
The glory of old  
It will be restored to you  
Your faces will glow  
Even on this earth before you go  
This year that's coming is a great revelation  
Revelation of the Father's love  
Revealed through his body  
Revealed through your faces, in your homes, in all places  
Expect the glory to shine through you  
And men in darkness to see it too  
For where you go great harvest earth will know  
And many who now bow to the wrong name, who like you son, Jesus lay claim  
Hallelujah, you will see it  
Hallelujah, you will be it  
All glory to God  
All creation will shout
