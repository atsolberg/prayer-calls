## Noon

Stay focused  
My miracles  
Take the high level
Declare  
Trust Jesus  
Lying snakes  
Wisdom  
Courage  
I will save this nation  
Evil has lost  
Do not be decieved  
Fear of the Lord  
Restore your faith  
They will not succeed  
Moving on earth  
The glory of God  
Give us rest  
He is speaking to us  
God's promise to Abraham  
Walk in line with me  
He will save us  
We are redeemed from the enemy  
Pray revelation
