## Evening  

_1 John 5:19_  
The world is under my power  
You are praying with my prophet and friend in my house  
For the upcoming Ezekiel war  
_Luke 21:36_  
**Listen Church, it must take place**  
_Revelation 1:1_  
Stay with me to the end of this  
_Matthew 24:13_  
Avoid, stay and listen tonight because I must move. **Do you understand?**  
_2 Timothy 3:1-10_  
I told you in my words  
It shall come to pass, you have my Spirit  
_Joel 2:28_  
_Acts 2:1-47_  
**But test the spirit Church**  
_1 John 4:1_  
Examine daily to see and know, you must know  
_1 Thessalonians 5:21_  
_1 John 4:1_  
Salvation, revelation, revival, awakening  
Trust in me
