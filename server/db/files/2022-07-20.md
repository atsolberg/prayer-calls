## Morning

Listen, I encourage you to meditate on my word  
I will do nothing without revealing to my prophet

Just listen, I will raise up for you  
Prophets among you  
**I am his Son**  
_Hebrews 1:1-2_  
My ways for you today  
_2 Peter 1:21_  
This is not act, she moved by me  
Listen to her  
_Deuteronomy 18:15-22_  
**This prophet spoken**  
The time for war is now  
_Ecclesiastes 3:8_  
They are and shall stumble  
And this is different, just understand  
Iran, Russia, Turkey, China, Syria, and many more  
**Will go back to their land**  
_Jeremiah 46:16_  
Israel, Church, and my son in America, when I say attack, go and attack  
_Joel 3:9_  
I am your light, I give you power  
**You shall not fall**  
_Micah 7:8_  
It is time to put on  
And keep it on

This is the purpose of me Church
