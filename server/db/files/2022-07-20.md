## Morning

Listen, I encourage you to meditate on my word

This is not act, she moved by me  
Listen to her  
_Deuteronomy 18:15-22_  
**This prophet spoken**  
The time for war is now  
_Ecclesiastes 3:8_  
They are and shall stumble  
And this is different, just understand  
Iran, Russia, Turkey, China, Syria, and many more  
**Will go back to their land**  
_Jeremiah 46:16_  
Israel, Church, and my son in America, when I say attack, go and attack  
_Joel 3:9_  
I am your light, I give you power  
**You shall not fall**  
_Micah 7:8_  
It is time to put on  
And keep it on  
_Ephesians 6:11_  
And after this short war I told you about, Ezekiel 38-39  
They will not take up or use any more bombing against you  
_Isaiah 2:4_  
It is impossible for me to lie  
_Numbers 23:19_  
**And I will and shall not change my mind**  
_1 Samuel 15:29_  
This is the purpose of me Church  
_John 17:3_  
I have to speak to you and remind you  
_John 8:26_  
**Who sent me is very true**  
My children, you shall be ok  
Trust my father who send me  
Trust in me
