_Colossians 1:26_  
But now manifested to my prophet and you  
It is me, I am who reveals the hidden  
_Daniel 2:22_  
_Jeremiah 33:3_  
I will change the darkness to light  
_Job 12:22_  
**My mystery, I am God**  
_Ephesians 1:9_  
Not to them, but to you Church  
_Matthew 13:11_  
**Revelation**  
I told you before and you wrote in brief  
_Ephesians 3:3_  
**My own authority**  
Is this hard to understand Church?  
_Acts 1:7_  
_Job 34:21_

Church, you have been praying for Trump and Israel  
_Psalms 139:2-3_  
_Jeremiah 17:10_

I see all, they are in my face  
China, Persia, Turkey, Syria, Russian, and many nations you already know  
**Ezekiel 38, Ezekiel 39**  
_Hosea 7:2_  
Just proclaim it, will take place  
_Isaiah 44:7_  
**My grace in full**  
_1 Peter 1:2_  
My justice is here, trust me  
_Psalms 37:4-6_  
Just acknowledge today and you paths will be straight  
_Proverbs 3:6_  
**Just abound in hope**  
_Romans 15:13_  
Remember what I said to the ruler of the synagogue  
**Keep your mind on me**  
_Mark 5:36_  
_Isaiah 26:3_  
See you at noon my beloved  
The blessing of my peace is shalom  
Trust in me
