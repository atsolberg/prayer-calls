## Noon

The Holy Spirit upon you  
His glory  
The power forever and ever amen  
I am in control  
Be strong  
Lord is faithful  
You answered  
Power (authority to operate)  
Who is able  
Restore  
Asking you to riegn  
You give us the words  
We are standing  
With you  
Lord, all, they are defeated  
Blessings  
I have lifted up the worries  
Defeated  
He would grant you  
Righteous
