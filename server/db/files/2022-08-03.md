## Morning

Pray, pray with my prophet, Church  
I will be coming at an hour you do not know  
**I am Jesus**  
_Matthew 24:42-44_  
The heavens be shaken  
_Luke 21:25-26_  
Children, it is Ezekiel 38-39  
_1 John 2:18_  
**And it will be a testimony**  
_Matthew 24:14_  
As I told you before  
_2 Timothy 3:1_  
The power of the clouds in heaven  
_Matthew 24:29-30_  
**Stay in my Spirit**  
_1 Timothy 4:1_  
And my people will flow to that  
_Micah 4:1_  
And my children in Israel at this time  
_Hosea 3:5_  
**This generation**  
_Matthew 24:34_  
**Will not go away**  
Listen, it will be established  
_Isaiah 2:2_  
It will be my revelation to all  
_Revelation 21:8_  
**Listen and think, this is for now**  
_1 Peter 1:20_  
_2 Peter 3:3_  
Pay attention Church, and behold  
_Acts 20:28_  
**Everyone shall see me**  
_Revelation 1:7_  
I has spoken to you today  
Through my friend and prophet  
_Hebrews 1:1-2_  
Knowledge and truth to all  
_2 Timothy 3:7_  
_Psalms 91:1-16_  
Trust in me
