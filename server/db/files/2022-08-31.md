## Morning

The earth is corrupt Church  
_Genesis 6:11_  
What is written, pray with my prophet and friend  
_Revelation 1:3_  
**I am your Jesus**  
Read my words Church, I see what is happening  
**See to it and don't be alarmed, Ezekiel 38-39**  
_Matthew 24:6_  
Listen, I am sending my Spirit to you all  
_Revelation 1:1_  
It shall go on from the beginning of my time  
_2 Peter 3:3-4_  
**Watch and pray, it will come to pass**  
_Luke 21:36_  
Listen, now the doctrines of the devils  
_1 Timothy 4:1_  
Great signs and great earthquakes  
But you Church will have my hope  
_Luke 21:11_  
No one but my father  
**Do you understand?**  
_Mark 13:32_  
It shall be according my promise  
And my day is coming for all  
_2 Peter 3:10-13_  
**It is near, your salvation is here**  
_Romans 13:11_  
You shall stand, I am not done  
_Isaiah 46:10_  
**I will be exalted and the nations shall follow**  
_Isaiah 2:2_  
Listen, you are of me Trump  
Yes, this is for you all  
_1 John 5:19_  
It is written in my book  
_Daniel 12:1_  
**They shall be delivered**  
You are called Israel, Church, Trump  
And you will see my purpose in it  
_Romans 8:28_  
Just, they will be judged  
**My rewards, I am**  
Judgment is given, and the time come, the days to come  
_Daniel 7:22_  
Trust in me
