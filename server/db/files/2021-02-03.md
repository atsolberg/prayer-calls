Return and seek the Lord  
All filled with the Holy Spirit 3x  
Speak in other tongues 3x

And shall be lifted up 3x

It is the last hour 2x  
They will not escape 3x  
He has spoken to us by his Son 3x  
I am the way 7x  
I am Christ 3x  
Will come times of difficulty 2x

The sign of your coming 3x  
The close of the age 2x  
Gather yourselves together 3x  
With his own blood 3x

Then you also must be ready 3x

Glory 7x  
My glory is over this nation and the nation of Israel
