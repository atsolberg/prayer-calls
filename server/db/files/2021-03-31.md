We can do all things through him  
Listen to my prophet to strenghen you through my words  
I will appear above my people 2x  
The grace of Jesus in your spirit 2x  
Who speak in tongues, speak to Jesus 2x  
You are led by the Spirit  
She prophesies to strengthen you  
Be one and live in peace  
I already passed judgment 3x  
Refresh my glorious Spirit and yours 2x  
Your freedom will not be stumbling  
Stand firm and go when you have oppurtunity  
You have my approval 3x  
On his way in my peace  
Do not seek your own good  
You will be changed 3x  
Wisdom 7x  
Knowledge 3x  
Nothing to fear 3x  
Seek the good of God for you now 2x

The storm will not last forever  
I will help and protect you to endure 2x  
Medidate on his promise  
Be strong 7x  
His promise is here  
Be still 7x  
I will comfort you 3x  
I know who take refuge in me  
You are in safe place with my Father  
I will shield you with my wings  
He is in my holy tent 3x  
Praise to my Father  
Drink my holy water 3x  
No one can stand before me  
Mighty storm coming 3x  
Storm of hail 3x  
It's going to pass  
I am striking down 2x  
Be in peace 7x  
I am the power  
Your King  
I am Lord  
Trust in me
