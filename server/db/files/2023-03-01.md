## Morning

**You will be happy, just wait**  
I am the king and I love justice  
Open to the Holy Spirit  
You are mine, listen to what I said to my prophet  
_Isaiah 43:1_

**The God of justice, justice and mercy**  
To restore and bring things in line to you and to them, my kingdom rule

I made it clear to you to act with justice  
**Seek and learn to do good**  
_Micah 6:8_  
Do what right  
My just shall roll down like waters  
Like flowing stream Church  
_Isaiah 56:1_  
It is my way, not the worlds  
**When you look around at whats happening in this world**  
_Matthew 6:33_  
_Colossians 3:2_  
_John 15:19_  
Pray deeper, pray for a deeper faith Church  
_Ephesians 2:8-9_  
_Matthew 17:20_  
And protection, intercession for my justice  
**Put on your armor and take your shield**

I will rise to your defence and I will give you victory
