## Noon
I am revealing to you through my prophet again  
Pray pray church

Preached my gospel, my kingdom

**They will come back**  
It will come to pass, I am your Jesus  
_Matthew 24:6_  
**You will shine**  
You believed  
_2 Corinthians 4:4_  
_Ephesians 6:12_  
But against rulers and darkness  
I am I am I am  
_Romans 13:11_  
Stay awake, the time is now  
Things are coming, all signs are here  
_Luke 21:25-26_  
**My signs**  
The heavens will be shaken  
_Matthew 24:29_  
**You you will not perish**  
You believed church  
You will not perish  
_John 3:16_  
This is for you today, my day is coming  
_2 Peter 3:10_  
**I am the son of the God**  
They are going to see my power  
**My glory**

The hour is coming upon all  
_Revelation 3:10_  
I am I am  
**I will come and I will do it**  
_Revelation 3:3_  
I am with you, my name, my blood

**Every knee should bow**  
_Phillipians 2:10_  
You are restored and saved
